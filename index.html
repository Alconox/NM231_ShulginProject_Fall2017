      Alexi Shulgin was born in Russia and works out of Moscow. He was trained as a photographer but moved on to internet art in the early to mid 90s. He has collaborated with many European artists and now helps run a new media art gallery. <b>
Shulgin used web in a variety of ways throughout his art projects, beginning in the late 90s. He has used web page formatting, such as drop down bars, form lists and the like to create aesthetic art. He has used pop ups to represent the id of the human mind. He has used the social aspect of the web to create repositories of people’s desktop backgrounds as a piece of internet performance art. He has parodied pornography and other websites that are ubiquitous on the internet as a whole. <b>
Shulgin’s work directly plays off of the expectations of the viewer. Even in the mid 90s websites themselves had a fairly common layout and format, and trends such as pronography were well known. Shulgin’s work plays on the expectations of the internet viewer who expects forms to act a certain way, expects popups to display certain things, and webpages to contain certain aspects. He uses these aspects in ways that they were not intended (forms to create art or so on) to make the viewer pause and think about his work.
Shulgin was working in the 1990s, using the original html made for netscape 3.0 or internet explorer. The ability to take these and cut and splice these elements into something unexpected takes a good  bit of work. The technology is simple, but his technique is precise. <b>
Shulgin is trying to express the nuances of human nature through the technical and clinical feeling of computer art. Using this medium he sheds light on the human connection to the internet -- such as his photo gallery of desktop backgrounds. These virtual spaces are displayed with the same reverence as any other personal space of an individual, and tell us about the individuals in the collection. Through something as simple as a desktop background, we can get a glimpse into the life of another person, frozen in time. Shulgin revels in this human-computer connection, focusing on uniquely personal, emotional, and relatable experiences in his works.
